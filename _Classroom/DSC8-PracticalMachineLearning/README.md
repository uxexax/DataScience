In this project I do classification of weight lifting exercises. I try out two different types of models, *random forests (RF)* and *gereralized boosting regression model (GBM)* with different parameters to find sufficient model(s) for prediction. Prediction is preceded by data preparation.

The predictions made in this document use the *Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset* of *Human Activity Recognition (HAR)*, see [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]. The data was downloaded from *cloudfront.net*:

* training data: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv]
* testing data: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv]

Notes:

* *raw.R* is only a sandbox for the Rmd file
* the figures in the *figures* folder are not used in the final paper, and are created only in *raw.R*
